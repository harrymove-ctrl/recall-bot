# CI/CD

Structure a repo's GitHub Actions automation into three concerns that stay
separated: what validates every change, what ships a specific commit
somewhere, and what gates or authenticates either one.

## Modes

**Init** (default) — stand up the path-filtered CI pipeline, per-environment
deploy workflows, policy gates, and the workflows README.

**Update** — add, rename, or retire a workflow; update the README
table and required checks in the same change.

**Verify** — report-only audit against the checks under `## Verify`;
never mutates.

## Three facets, one split

- **CI structure** — one path-filtered validation pipeline gating everything
  that runs on a push or PR. Read `references/ci-structure.md` when setting up
  or speeding up CI.
- **Deploy & release** — dispatch-against-ref deployment of a reviewed commit
  to a named environment, plus release integrity for anything irreversible.
  Read `references/deploy-and-release.md` when adding or changing a deploy or
  release workflow.
- **Policy & auth** — required-check gates, branch-protection rulesets, and
  automation credentials. Read `references/policy-and-auth.md` when wiring a
  gate or an automation identity.

Never fold validation and deployment into one workflow: a push that only
changes docs must not queue behind a deploy, and a deploy must never
accidentally run on every push that happens to touch the workflow file.

## GitHub ↔ IaC mapping is this skill's contract

`cmk:infra` names environments as first-class, tool-neutral entities
(`production`, `staging`, `dev`, `canary`, plus ephemeral per-effort stacks)
and requires each to have a deploy path; this skill specifies that path. The
contract is **1:1:1**: every IaC stack pairs with exactly one GitHub
Environment of the same name and exactly one deploy workflow that targets it.
Secrets live only in that protected GitHub Environment, never in
repository-wide secrets or plain variables. Read `cmk:infra` for the
environment vocabulary itself; read `references/deploy-and-release.md` here
for how the pairing is wired.

## `workflows/README.md` is the operating doc

Every workflow gets one row in a table at `.github/workflows/README.md`:
name, purpose, and trigger. A workflow with a non-obvious contract (a release
gate's promotion rule, a reconciliation job's opt-in variable) gets its own
subsection below the table. Adding, renaming, or retiring a workflow updates
this table in the same change — it is the first thing a reader or another
agent opens to learn what automation exists, not a changelog reconciled
later.

## What this teaches vs. what a project owns

This skill teaches shapes and the traps around them — never a frozen workflow
catalog to copy verbatim. Recognize and avoid: **cold-cache poisoning** (a
scheduled cold job whose own setup step silently re-warms a shared cache, so
the regression it exists to catch can no longer show up); **skipped-job-
reports-success** (a path-filtered job that didn't run still reports a green
check, so the gating job itself, not the per-area jobs, must be what's
required); **workflow-token-doesn't-trigger-CI** (automation that pushes with
the built-in workflow token produces commits that never fire downstream CI,
silently leaving a rewritten ref unverified).

Projects own: which area jobs exist and their path filters; runner labels and
pool sizing; which policy gates are enabled; deploy-leg composition; label
names, schedules, and cache backends; which checks become required in the
ruleset.

## Verify

Report-only — never mutate:

- Exactly one path-filtered CI workflow exists, with a required
  change-detection job every other CI job depends on.
- Every deployable has exactly one deploy workflow, and it takes a commit SHA
  and a target environment as explicit inputs — never an implicit
  branch-only trigger for anything promotable.
- Required checks are pinned by name in a branch-protection ruleset and match
  actual workflow job names — no drift between the two.
- No long-lived cloud credential sits in a secret where OIDC federation is
  available.
- `.github/workflows/README.md` lists every workflow and is current with the
  workflows on disk.
