name: cmk:delivery-pipeline
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "work on", "deliver", "tackle", "pick up", or "implement" a tracker issue (TICKET-123), a list of issues, or a body of tracked work expected to finish without supervision — even if they never say "pipeline". Also use when handed a cluster of related issues, or a single issue whose surrounding cluster should be derived from tracker dependencies, expecting dependency-aware sequencing across worktrees.

# Delivery Pipeline

Deliver tracker-tracked work end to end with no human in the loop. When the
user returns, the outcome is a reviewable PR (or PRs), an up-to-date tracker
graph, and a written track record of every material fact, decision, state
change, handoff, and follow-up — not a list of questions.

CMK owns the lifecycle. Superpowers executes inside it. The division:

| CMK owns | superpowers owns |
|---|---|
| The tracker as the delivery ledger | how a task is implemented and debugged |
| Phase order and gates | the per-task implement → review → fix loop |
| Repo quality bar, production readiness | spec pressure-testing and plan authoring |
| Review lenses, evidence bar, disposition, depth disclosure | completion verification |
| Autonomy — no human gates | parallel-dispatch hygiene |
| Cluster dependency graph, readiness frontier, task independence | |

Before acting, read:

1. `cmk:delivery-workflow` — the tracking contract. Every phase operates
   inside it.
2. `references/engineering-principles.md` — autonomy, production readiness,
   and the delegation contract.
3. Your runtime's binding for mechanics only (see `cmk:delivery-workflow`'s
   `references/vendor-bindings.md`). A binding supplies mechanics; it never
   changes phase order, gates, evidence, or acceptance.

## Working with superpowers

Superpowers skills are written for a human-supervised session. Two rules
adapt them everywhere in this pipeline, including skills added later:

1. **Human gates are suppressed.** Any point where a skill stops to ask the
   operator — consent, approval, "which approach?", a typed confirmation —
   does not apply: decide it and record the decision and rationale on the
   durable surface the phase already requires (spec, review record, PR
   description, or the owning tracker issue). A question that genuinely
   cannot be decided safely is a recorded blocker
   (`references/engineering-principles.md` § Autonomy). Four decisions keep
   a named CMK owner instead: a plan conflict is a review finding
   dispositioned under `cmk:delivery-review`; review feedback colliding
   with a prior decision is that skill's call; branch integration is not a
   menu, since phase 5 opens a PR against a canonical branch; and starting
   on the default branch is not a consent question, since intake already
   placed the run on its own branch.
2. **A skill returns at its boundary** — it does not advance the phase and
   does not delete a workspace. `superpowers:writing-plans` ends when the
   plan is written without invoking an execution engine;
   `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` ends at the last task's ledger
   line without deleting its workspace (phases 4 and 5 read it as evidence)
   or chaining into `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`;
   `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` reports the existing worktree rather
   than creating a second one.

The issue's worktree and branch are intake's to create and nobody's to
remove — the durable workspace for every relay agent; a skill may create
its own scratch workspace and phase 5 retires it once its evidence is
durable. Specs and plans go to git-ignored scratch and are never committed;
durable conclusions reach `docs/design/`, `docs/decisions/`, the tracker,
and the PR.

## Phase 0: run notes

Once per run, write to git-ignored scratch (e.g.
`docs/plans/<issue>-run-notes.md`): the active runtime, the worktree path
per issue, the path of phase 3's execution workspace, and any review depth
the operator explicitly chose. Every later phase and handoff receiver
reads this instead of rediscovering it — keep it to those four things.

## The phases

| Phase | Skill / engine | CMK adds |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Intake | `cmk:delivery-intake` | all of it — the tracker has no superpowers equivalent |
| 2. Spec & plan | `cmk:delivery-spec-plan`, via `superpowers:brainstorming` + `superpowers:writing-plans` | design-doc inputs; `Depends on:`, `File scope:`, and binding obligations inside each task body |
| 3. Implement | `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (below) | wave dispatch and its safety fixes |
| 4. Review | `cmk:delivery-review` | lenses, evidence bar, adversarial verification, disposition, depth disclosure |
| 5. Ship | `cmk:delivery-ship` | PR, tracker reconciliation, evidence |
| (any boundary) | `cmk:delivery-handoff` | relay prompt for another agent |

Each phase skill is independently invokable when the user asks for just
that slice, through the runtime's own skill mechanism or by reading the
file directly. Phases are checkpoints, not ceremonies: a one-line config
fix does not need a design spec, but it still needs intake, task proof,
review, and ship. Scale phase depth to the change; never skip one outright.

Executing phase 3? Read `references/phase-3-execution.md`.

## Single-issue mode

One issue (or one issue plus sub-issues jointly delivering one outcome):
run phases 1–5 in order inside one worktree.

## Cluster mode

Delivering a named list of related issues, or a single seed issue whose
surrounding cluster should be derived from tracker dependencies? Read
`references/cluster-mode.md` before scheduling anything — it covers
dependency closure, readiness gates, frontier scheduling, and
worktree-per-issue.

## Cross-agent handoff

The operator may run phases on different AI agents to exploit each one's
strengths. When asked to hand off — or told up front that a later phase
belongs to another agent — stop at the phase boundary and follow
`cmk:delivery-handoff`. Continuity is non-negotiable: every agent in the
relay works in the same worktree and branch per issue, navigating into the
worktrees intake created rather than creating, re-basing, or wiping any.
That is why every phase writes its state to artifacts — the next agent
reconstructs the work from files, never from a chat it wasn't part of.

## Completion report

End every run with a report the user can act on in one read:

```
## Delivered
- TICKET-123 <title> — PR #N (base: <branch>), status: review state
  - outcome summary, entry points, test evidence one-liner
  - acceptance: <n of m criteria checked with evidence; the rest by disposition>
## Decisions made autonomously
- <decision> — rationale recorded at <surface>
## Rescoped (if any)
- TICKET-123 — criteria removed and why, now carried by TICKET-124 with its own AC
## Deferred / follow-ups
- TICKET-125 <new issue> — why deferred, priority, estimate, links
## Blocked (if any)
- TICKET-126 — blocker, recorded where, suggested unblock
```

A run that narrowed an issue says so in its own section rather than
folding it into deferrals — a deferral is extra work found along the way,
a rescope is the accepted outcome getting smaller — and when review ran
below full depth, plain words say which issue, what depth, who asked for
it, and that the run shipped below its standard gate: no reader can
recover that difference unless it is written down. Every line in that
report must already exist on its durable surface; the report summarizes
the track record, and is never its only copy.
